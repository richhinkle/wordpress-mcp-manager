# WordPress MCP Manager - TODO List

## üö® High Priority - Progress Tracking Completion

### Real-Time Progress Tracking (90% Complete)
**Status**: Core infrastructure implemented, needs debugging

**What's Working**:
- ‚úÖ Server-Sent Events (SSE) infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Progress session management
- ‚úÖ Backend progress tracking integration
- ‚úÖ Immediate feedback messages
- ‚úÖ Core scraping functionality with progress hooks

**What Needs Fixing**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è SSE connection debugging (EventSource not displaying updates)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Progress message formatting ("system" messages appearing incorrectly)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Visual progress bars not updating in real-time
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Error handling for failed SSE connections

**Files to Debug**:
- `static/app.js` - ProgressTracker class and SSE connection
- `src/api/progress_routes.py` - SSE streaming endpoint
- Progress message display functions

**Expected Outcome**:
```
üöÄ Starting scrape of @username... [‚ñì‚ñì‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë] 20%
üîç Scraping posts via Apify... [‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë] 40%
üñºÔ∏è Caching images (15/20)... [‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñë‚ñë] 80%
‚úÖ Successfully scraped 20 posts! [‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì] 100%
```
